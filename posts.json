        "fullContent": "<p>In a groundbreaking experiment, researchers have demonstrated the sustained teleportation of high-fidelity quantum qubits over a distance of 27 miles (44 kilometers). This achievement marks a significant step towards a practical quantum internet.</p><p>The quantum internet promises to revolutionize communication by providing a level of security that is theoretically unhackable. Unlike classical bits, which can be either 0 or 1, quantum bits (qubits) can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously.</p><p>\"We are thrilled by these results,\" said Dr. Elena Rostova, lead physicist on the project. \"It moves us from the realm of theoretical physics into practical engineering. The fidelity of our teleportation remained above 90%, which is the threshold needed for a working network.\"</p><p>The next steps involve scaling this technology to create larger networks, potentially linking cities and eventually, continents. This could lead to a new era of secure banking, confidential government communications, and distributed quantum computing.</p>",

While powerful, this can introduce permanent errors. The new technique works more like a volume knob, turning genes up or down by adding chemical tags to the DNA, a process known as epigenetics.</p><p>This breakthrough has immense potential for treating diseases like Alzheimer's and various cancers, where the goal is to silence a harmful gene rather than remove it entirely. Best of all, the process is reversible.</p>",
